# SneakerBeast
SneakerBeast is a RESTFul API created for my CSC 435 (Web Services) course. It is heavily modeled after the existing website StockX. StockX is an online trading platform where users can buy and sell luxury items, such as rare sneakers and designer handbags.

## Implementation and Frameworks
This project was implmented in 4 different frameworks over the course of the semester (Java EE, Spark Java, Grails, Dropwizard). The API is accessible via Localhost and could recieve or display information via various HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, etc.) Error messages and credentials can be monitored using Postman.
